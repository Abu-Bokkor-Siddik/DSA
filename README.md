# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (C++)

This project implements a simple C++ program to find the **length of the longest substring** in a given string **without repeating characters**.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Accepts user input from the console.
- Uses nested loops to check all possible substrings.
- Calculates and displays the longest substring length.
- Simple and beginner-friendly C++ code.

---

## ðŸ§  Algorithm Explanation

The program loops through all characters in the string:

1. Starts from each index `i`.
2. Expands a substring from that index until a repeated character is found.
3. Keeps track of the **maximum length** found so far.
